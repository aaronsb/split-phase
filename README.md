# AC Waveform & Inverter Simulator

An interactive educational tool for understanding AC electrical systems, split-phase power, and electrical faults. Designed for RV builders, off-grid enthusiasts, and anyone learning electrical systems.

## Features

### Split-Phase Visualization
- Real-time visualization of North American split-phase electrical systems
- Shows L1 and L2 hot legs (180Â° out of phase)
- Demonstrates 120V and 240V load connections

### Oscilloscope-Style Controls
- **No Trigger**: Free-running waveform sweep
- **Auto Trigger**: Edge-locked stable display
- **Manual Trigger**: User-controlled phase positioning
- Variable time base (0.01x to 5x speed)

### Comprehensive Fault Simulation
- **120V Load Faults**: Motor startups, arc faults, resistive switching
- **240V Load Faults**: Heavy motor startups, A/C compressors, load imbalances
- **System Faults**: Neutral loss, phase imbalance, ground faults
- **Inverter Faults**: MOSFET failures, transformer saturation, DC injection
- Multiple simultaneous faults supported
